# Week 6/7 Updates

> Do it. Go get it done. 

## Version 1
*  Version 1 of logo
* PDF format
* No larger that 8.5" x 11"

## References
In additional to [Learning Logo Design][1], there are many (many) resources. Again, as a 400 level class excludes “how to design a thing”. This is a class about all the things involved in — making a thing. Refer to the many courses on Lynda. 

* [Learning Logo Design by Von Glitschka ][2]
* [Logo Design Techniques by Nigel French][3] is also good

## Incubating Assignments
Grading for Professional Practice happens toward the end of the Quarter. This gives you as much time to really think about it (but makes grading a chore for me).
