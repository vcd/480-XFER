## Observe. Refine. Apply.
I do not think the conversational approach is working this quarter (it was successful in past classes). Maybe it’s the space. CHN 204 is better suited for this. Please do not lose sight of the *WHY* because of *how* it’s presented. 

## Assignments & Grading
Grading is postponed. There is too much incomplete work. All work back-dated work will *not* be late. Work due after Jan. 28th, however will be. Please get it done. 

Thank you to those who completed everything.

Good questions and discussion was had with the Client. Be able to write your own `Creative Briefs` and also identify poorly-written `Creative Briefs`.
